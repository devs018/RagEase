# Sales Table Documentation

## Table: sales

### Description  
The sales table tracks all sales transactions with detailed information about products sold, amounts, dates, regions, and the responsible employees.

### Schema Details
- **id** (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY): Unique sale transaction identifier
- **employee_id** (INTEGER): Foreign key linking to employees.id
- **product** (TEXT): Product name from standard catalog
- **amount** (REAL): Sale amount in USD, typically 100-5000 range
- **sale_date** (DATE): Transaction date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **region** (TEXT): Geographic sales region

### Valid Values
**Regions:** North, South, East, West, Central
**Products:** Laptop, Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor, Headphones, Tablet, Phone, Charger

### Relationships
- **employee_id** → employees.id (Many-to-One)
- Each sale is attributed to exactly one employee
- Employees can have multiple sales records

### Advanced Query Patterns
```sql
-- Sales performance by employee
SELECT 
    e.name, 
    e.department,
    COUNT(s.id) as total_sales,
    SUM(s.amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(s.amount) as avg_sale_amount
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN sales s ON e.id = s.employee_id 
GROUP BY e.id, e.name, e.department
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Regional performance analysis
SELECT 
    region,
    COUNT(*) as sales_count,
    SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(amount) as avg_sale_amount,
    MIN(amount) as min_sale,
    MAX(amount) as max_sale
FROM sales 
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Product performance metrics
SELECT 
    product,
    COUNT(*) as units_sold,
    SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(amount) as avg_price,
    COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) as sellers_count
FROM sales 
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Time series analysis
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y-%m', sale_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as sales_count,
    SUM(amount) as monthly_revenue
FROM sales 
GROUP BY month 
ORDER BY month;

-- Top performers by region
SELECT 
    s.region,
    e.name,
    SUM(s.amount) as regional_sales
FROM sales s
JOIN employees e ON s.employee_id = e.id
GROUP BY s.region, e.id, e.name
ORDER BY s.region, regional_sales DESC;
