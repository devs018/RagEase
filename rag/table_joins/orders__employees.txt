JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id

-- Sales rep performance analysis
SELECT e.name as sales_rep, COUNT(o.id) as orders_handled,

FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN orders o ON e.id = o.employee_id
WHERE e.department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales')
GROUP BY e.id, e.name

-- Monthly sales performance by employee
SELECT e.name as sales_rep, strftime('%Y-%m', o.order_date) as month,
       COUNT(o.id) as orders, SUM(o.total_amount) as monthly_sales
FROM employees e
JOIN orders o ON e.id = o.employee_id
