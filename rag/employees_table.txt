SELECT 
    department,
    MIN(salary) as min_salary,
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary, 
    MAX(salary) as max_salary,
    COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;

-- Age distribution analysis
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 30 THEN 'Under 30'
        WHEN age < 40 THEN '30-39'
        WHEN age < 50 THEN '40-49'
        ELSE '50+'
    END as age_group,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM employees
